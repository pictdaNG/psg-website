Furthermore, the Lalong administration approved and employed over four hundred Agricultural Extension Workers who have been graduates of many of our national Colleges of Agriculture. Not relenting in ensuring agricultural activities get considerable boosts, Lalong’s administration has in the past three and half years ensured inputs support through fertilizers, herbicides, insecticides and seeds, which have been provided at subsidized rates. The Panyam Fish farm has been witnessing remarkable improvements in fish fingerlings production and cropping or harvest. All these initiatives in agricultural activities have led to yearly bumper harvest, food security and poverty alleviation.</p>
