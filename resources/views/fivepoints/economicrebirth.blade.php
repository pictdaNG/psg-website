        <p>
            The past four years have witnessed the most challenging period in the economy of Nigeria, which by extension affected all the States in the country including Plateau. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The compelling economic recession and the sharp drop in oil revenue which negatively impacted our share of Federal Allocation has created the inevitable need for us in Plateau State to search for avenues of developing and growing our economy in a sustainable manner based on our resource endowments.
        </p>

            Apart from the impending increase in public sector expenditure resulting from the implementation of the new minimum wage, there is the need to meet the expectations of our electorate who gave us the mandate, by executing the necessary projects and programs that will justify their trust in government. Without the necessary financial resources, these two key objectives will not be met
        </p>

        <p>
            We must therefore see the next four years as a period devoted to putting in place policies and strategies that will generate necessary financial resources that will fund our development without relying exclusively on Federation account. It will not be business as usual. Based on our resource endowments including excellent weather, Plateau State has the potential to be  leader  in virtually all aspects of economic activity and we must lay the foundation for converting these potentials into concrete gains.
        </p>

        <p>
            During the next four years, Government hopes to accomplish the following:
        </p>

        <p>
            Although we were able increase our Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) from N6.9billion per annum in 2015 to N12.7billion per annuum in 2018, almost 100% increase, yet this level of IGR is grossly inadequate to meet what the Rescue administration needs to fund our recurrent and capital expenditure in the next 4 years. We shall therefore re-invigorate our IGR machinery to ensure that we generate a minimum of N2.5biilion per month or N50billion per annuum in the next four years. All MDAs must henceforth see their activities as not only geared towards service delivery, but also as revenue generating centres.
        </p>

        <p>
            Besides pursuing a robust revenue generating policy in the next four years, we will pay special attention to exploiting and developing our resource endowments namely Agriculture, Mineral Resources, Tourism and Human Capital using different strategic approaches.
        </p>
        <p>
            Going forward, the Rescue administration phase II will take concrete steps to encourage commercial agriculture and Food Processing, Livestock and Dairy Development.
        </p>

        <p>
            In specific terms, we will pay special attention to those crops that are unique to Plateau State or in which we have competitive advantage like apples, coffee, strawberries, rose flowers, Irish potatoes, acha etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            The ASTC and the PADP will be revamped and repositioned to achieve their goals, while the Government will complete the purchase of BARC farms to serve as a vehicle for joint partnership with reputable commercial agricultural firms.
        </p>

        <p>
            Provision of critical inputs like seedlings and fertilizers will be a top priority, in addition to upgrading the Extension Advisory Services.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lamentably, the huge mineral resource endowments of our state have remained mere potentials without adding value to our people. In the next four years Government will adopt a new approach; given our newly promulgated Policy on Mineral Development. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In preparation for this, the State Government has revived its Mineral Development Company (PMDC Ltd) and will adequately recapitalize it to serve as our vehicle for any joint partnership with serious minded investors.
        </p>

        <p>
            Similarly, the State Government has entered into partnership with PW Ltd to produce relevant geo-technical data and survey maps that would facilitate and fast track the investment in the mining sector
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition, we have set in motion machinery for working relationship between relevant State agencies and the Federal Ministry of Mines and Mining Development to ensure that mining activities in the State are effectively monitored and the interest of our people protected.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the tourism sector, the state Government recently declared a State of Emergency in the sector. This implies paying special attention in terms of upgrading our tourist facilities and creating the conducive environment for both domestic and international tourism to grow.
        </p>

        <p>
            In appreciation of contributions of the private sector in partnering with us to drive the economy of the State, government will continue to place emphasis in creating more conducive and enabling environment for business to thrive. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Government will ensure that the necessary incentives like easier access to land titles are implemented and the State One-Stop-Shop Initiative is completed so that all obstacles to doing business are removed. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Plateau State is blessed with huge human capital. Our bulging youth population is a very special asset that will be aggressively harnessed especially in areas of entrepreneurship and ICT so as to tackle unemployment. Government will maximally utilize the enormous potentials that abound with the creation of the Plateau ICT Development Agency (PICTDA).   
        </p>

        <p>
            The PLASMIDA will be specially empowered to undertake entrepreneurship and skills training for youth and women across the State as a deliberate strategy for boosting self-reliance. A special Enterprise Fund of N2billion Naira in partnership between PLASMIDA and the Bank of Industry will soon take off to provide loans and capacity building for Entrepreneurs across the State. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The State Government intends to collaborate with the Federal Ministry of Transportation and the Nigerian Shippers Council to fast-track the completion of the Heipang Inland Container Port, Government will conclude discussions with Chinese investors to take advantage of the status of the Yakubu Gowon Airport as an Agro-Cargo airport and explore the establishment of an  Agro-Industrial Park for food processing and fruit and vegetables  export.
