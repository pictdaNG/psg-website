{{--            The administration came with the mindset to revamp the state’s economy, promote the spirit of entrepreneurship and resuscitate industrialization. The goal of the administration is to create wealth, improve living standards and reduce poverty. To achieve this goal, it has rolled out a robust economic blueprint aimed at enhancing growth and creating job opportunities for our teeming unemployed citizens. The administration has taken a hard look at the economic growth of the state. The administration has thus come up with a viable diversification plan and therefore identified, agriculture, solid mineral, manufacturing and tourism as key sectors on which to center its focus.--}}

{{--            The administration also considers the role of private sector as an engine of economic growth and has thus opened its doors wide towards partnering with core private investors in order to move the state’s economy forward.

All these business and investment friendly efforts which are fast yielding positive results are geared towards turning the state into the viable investment and industrial zone it used to be.
