            PROTOCOL
        </h4>
        
        <p>
            I am very delighted and honoured to host the 2019 NIPR Governing Council Retreat in Jos, the Plateau State capital. Indeed, hosting a professional group like the NIPR is not an easy task because each and every action you take in trying to be a good host would be put to test. But I am confident that with the arrangements put in place by the state chapter of the NIPR and government's support, Council members and other PR practitioners who have come for the various activities around the Retreat would enjoy the unique Plateau hospitality.
        </p>

        <p>
            May I seize this opportunity to commend the NIPR for the choice of the state for its Retreat. This is because for a retreat to be successful, it has to take place in an ideal environment such as Jos. I assure you that as you brainstorm on the way forward for PR practice in Nigeria, the Institute will be reinvented for better performance.

            Similarly, this administration is aware that public relations is a prerequisite for harmonious coexistence in our society. You will recall that between 2001 and 2015, hundreds of people lost their lives while many others lost their homes and livelihoods as a result of these attacks. The establishment of the Plateau Peace Building Agency (PPBA) in February 2016 by this administration was both an institutional and public relations response to the increasing challenges of armed conflicts that have bedeviled the state for almost two decades. The fundamental role and function of the Peace Building Agency is to promote the culture of peace and harmonious coexistence among the diverse ethno-religious groups in the state.

        </p>


        <p>
            Distinguished Council members, as you take stock of PR practice since the last Governing Council Retreat, and deliberate on its future role in the development of our dear nation during this Retreat, I urge you to consider the Plateau example by developing a roadmap to peace and harmonious coexistence among the different ethnic groups in Nigeria. This is imperative because our image as a nation has been negatively affected by ethnic, religious, political and other cleavages. 
  
        </p>

        <p>
            As public relation officers and image makers of our society, you are better informed on Governments Ranching Policy and for those of you who are not thorough on it, the door of the technical committee on the implementation of ranching is widely open for information seekers on the policy. I therefore appeal to you to join government in sensitizing the general public by letting them know that our choice of ranching is a means to curb the challenges of insecurity in our state. Worthy of note is that no individual, community, Local Government Area or State will be under compulsion to relinquish his or her land but suffice to say that every land to be used shall be free volition.  

        </p>

        <p>
            In conclusion, I wish you a very successful and memorable Retreat and look forward to more collaboration with NIPR as we strive to implement policies and programmes that will uplift the living standard of our people.

        </p>

        <p>
            It is now my singular honour and privilege to declare the 2019 NIPR Governing Council Retreat, holding in Jos, the Plateau State capital, open.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Thank you and God bless.</strong>
        </p>

            <strong>RT. HON. SIMON BAKO LALONG.</strong> <br />
            <strong>EXECUTIVE GOVERNOR.</strong>
